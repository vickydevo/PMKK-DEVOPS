# Setting Up a Jenkins Slave Node (Agent) on AWS EC2 Using SSH  

## Prerequisites  
1. **Jenkins Master** already installed on an EC2 instance.  
2. **Slave Node** (another EC2 instance) with:  
    - Jenkins user created.  
    - SSH access configured.  
    - Java installed.  

---

## Step-by-Step Guide  

### 1. Create and Configure the Slave EC2 Instance  
- Launch a new EC2 instance (slave) with appropriate specs (e.g., `t2.micro`).  
- Ensure the security group allows inbound traffic on port `22` (for SSH access).  
- Install Java on the slave:  
  ```bash  
  sudo apt update  # For Ubuntu/Debian  
  sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y  
  java -version  # Verify Java installation  
  ```  

### 2. Create a Jenkins User on the Slave Node  
- On the slave EC2 instance, create a user for Jenkins:  
  ```bash  
  sudo adduser jenkins  
  sudo usermod -aG sudo jenkins  # Give sudo privileges if needed  
  ```  
- Switch to the `jenkins` user:  
  ```bash  
  su - jenkins  
  ```  

### 3. Configure SSH Keys for Jenkins Connection  
- Generate SSH keys on your Jenkins master instance:  
  ```bash  
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "jenkins-slave"  # Leave all prompts blank for defaults  
  ```  
- Copy the public key to the slave instance:  
  ```bash  
  ssh-copy-id jenkins@<slave-instance-public-ip>  
  ```  
  Alternatively, manually copy the contents of the public key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) and add it to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the slave node.  

### 4. Configure the Slave Node in Jenkins  
- On the Jenkins master web UI, go to **Manage Jenkins > Manage Nodes and Clouds > New Node**.  
- Provide a node name (e.g., `Slave1`) and select **Permanent Agent**.  
- Configure the following settings:  
  - **Remote root directory**: `/root` (or the home directory of the `jenkins` user on the slave).  
  - **Usage**: Select the appropriate usage, such as "Use this node as much as possible."  
  - **Launch method**: Choose **Launch agents via SSH**.  
  - **Host**: Enter the public IP or DNS of the slave instance.  
  - **Credentials**:  
     - Add the SSH credentials for the `jenkins` user. In **Credentials**, select **Jenkins → Add → SSH Username with Private Key**.  
        - **Username**: `jenkins`  
        - **Private Key**: Select **Enter directly**, and copy-paste the private key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`) from the master instance.  
  - **Host Key Verification Strategy**: You can choose **Manually trusted key Verification Strategy** for simplicity.  

### 5. Test the SSH Connection  
- Click on the **Save** button and Jenkins will attempt to connect to the slave via SSH.  
- If the connection is successful, the node status will show **Online**.  

### 6. Verify the Node is Running  
- Once the node is set up, it will appear under **Manage Nodes** with an **Online** status.  
- You can test by configuring a Jenkins job to run on this specific node using the **Restrict where this project can be run** option (set to the node’s label).

## Troubleshooting  
- **Security Groups**: Ensure that the security group of the slave EC2 instance allows SSH (port `22`) from the master instance.  
- **Java**: Ensure that Java is installed and correctly configured on the slave instance.  
- **SSH Key**: Ensure that the SSH key permissions on the slave node are set to:  
  ```bash  
  chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys  
  ```  

This should set up your Jenkins master to connect and use the EC2 slave node for running jobs.  

## Setting Up Webhooks in Git for Jenkins Pipeline Job  

### 1. Enable Webhooks in Your Git Repository  
- Go to your Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).  
- Navigate to **Settings > Webhooks**.  
- Click on **Add Webhook**.  

### 2. Configure the Webhook  
- **Payload URL**: Enter the Jenkins webhook URL. This is typically:  
    ```
    http://<jenkins-server-url>/github-webhook/
    ```  
    Replace `<jenkins-server-url>` with your Jenkins server's public URL.  
- **Content Type**: Select `application/json`.  
- **Events**: Choose the events to trigger the webhook. For example:  
    - **Just the push event** (recommended for most cases).  
    - Or **Let me select individual events** and choose specific events like `push` and `pull_request`.  
- Click **Add Webhook** to save the configuration.  

### 3. Configure Jenkins Pipeline Job to Use the Webhook. 
- In Jenkins, create or configure a pipeline job.  
- Under the **Build Triggers** section, enable **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling** (or the equivalent for your Git provider).  

### 4. Test the Webhook  
- Push a commit to the repository or trigger an event configured in the webhook.  
- Verify that Jenkins starts the pipeline job automatically.

### 5. Troubleshooting  
- **Webhook Delivery**: Check the webhook delivery logs in your Git repository to ensure the payload is sent successfully.  
- **Jenkins Logs**: Check the Jenkins logs for any errors related to the webhook.  
- **Firewall/Network**: Ensure that your Jenkins server is accessible from the internet if hosted on a private network.  

This setup ensures that your Jenkins pipeline job is triggered automatically whenever changes are pushed to the Git repository.
