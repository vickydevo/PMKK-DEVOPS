# Introduction to Ansible

## Overview
Ansible is an open-source, command-line IT automation tool written in Python. It is widely used for automating tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, and system updates.

## Key Features of Ansible
- **Agentless Architecture**: No need to install agents on managed nodes.
- **Push Model**: Executes tasks by pushing configurations from a central control node.

## Use Cases

### 1. Configure Systems
Ansible can be used to configure systems efficiently.  
**Examples**:
- Create a `dbadmin` user on all servers.
- Open specific ports on all database servers.

### 2. Deploy Software/Applications
Ansible simplifies software and application deployment.  
**Examples**:
- Install the `nc` command on all servers.
- Install and configure a web server.

### 3. Update Systems / Apply Patches
Ansible helps in keeping systems up-to-date by applying patches and updates.

### 4. Provisioning
Ansible can provision servers, although tools like Terraform are often preferred for this purpose.

## Why Use Ansible?
- **Configuration Management**: Ensures systems are in the desired state.
- **Automation**: Reduces manual effort and human error.

Ansible is a powerful tool for IT automation, making it an essential part of modern DevOps practices.

## Ways to Use Ansible

We can use Ansible in two ways:
1. **Ansible CLI Commands (Ad Hoc Commands)**: These are one-liner commands executed directly from the command line for quick tasks.
2. **Ansible Playbooks**: Written in simple YAML files, playbooks allow for more complex and repeatable automation tasks.

> **Note**: Both Ansible CLI Commands/Ad Hoc Commands and Ansible Playbooks rely on modules to perform tasks.

## Ansible Distributions & Versions
  Starting from version 2.10, Ansible is available in two distributions:

1. **Ansible Core**
    - The actual Ansible tool used to run ad hoc commands and playbooks.
    - Comes with a minimal set of modules to work with your environment.

2. **Ansible Community**
    - Built on top of Ansible Core and includes community collections/modules.
    - Allows for extended functionality by installing additional collections/modules as needed.

#### Key Points to Remember
- You can install either Ansible Core or Ansible Community based on your project requirements.
- Both distributions can be installed using the `pip` command.

## Setting Up Ansible Using WSL on Windows

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) allows you to run a Linux environment directly on Windows. Follow these steps to set up Ansible using WSL:

### 1. Enable WSL Feature
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator.
2. Run the following command to enable the WSL feature:

### 2. Restart Your Computer
Restart your computer to apply the changes.

### 3. Install a Linux Distribution
1. Open the Microsoft Store.
2. Search for your preferred Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu).
3. Click **Install** to download and install the distribution.

### 4. Set Up the Linux Distribution
1. Launch the installed Linux distribution from the Start menu.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup (e.g., creating a username and password).

### 5. Update WSL to WSL 2 (Optional)
1. Download the latest WSL 2 kernel update package from the [Microsoft WSL documentation](https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel).
2. Install the package.
3. Set WSL 2 as the default version:
    ```bash
    wsl --set-default-version 2
    ```

### 6. Verify WSL Installation
To check the installed WSL version and distributions, run:
```bash
wsl -l -v
```

> **Note**: Ensure that your Windows version supports WSL 2. You can check this in the [WSL documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

### 7. Set Default WSL Distribution
To set a specific distribution as the default, use:
```bash
wsl -s <distribution_name>
```
For example, to set Ubuntu as the default:
```bash
wsl -s Ubuntu  

wsl --unregister Ubuntu
```

### 8. Shutdown WSL
To shut down all running WSL distributions, use:
```bash
wsl --shutdown
```

## Installing Ansible Using Virtual Environment

A Python virtual environment provides an isolated space to install and manage Python packages. Here's how to install Ansible using a virtual environment:

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv ~/ansible_venv
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment
```bash
source ~/ansible_venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Ansible Inside the Environment
```bash
pip install ansible==12        # For Python 3.12
pip install ansible==2.19.1    # Install specific version
```

### 4. Deactivate When Done
```bash
deactivate
```

### 5. Verify Installation
Check Ansible Core version:
```bash
/home/ansadmin/ansible_venv/bin/ansible --version
```

Check Ansible Community version:
```bash
ansible --version
```

> **Note**: Using a virtual environment helps avoid conflicts between different Python packages and versions.

## Installing Ansible Using pipx

You can also install Ansible using [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/), which helps you run Python applications in isolated environments.

### 1. Install pipx
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install pipx
```

### 2. Ensure pipx is in Your PATH
```bash
pipx ensurepath
```
Restart your terminal or source your shell configuration:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc   # or ~/.zshrc
```

### 3. Install Ansible (e.g., version 2.17)
```bash
pipx uninstall ansible==12 # for python 3.12
pipx install ansible-core==2.17
```

### 4. Verify Installation
```
ansible-community --version
ansible --version
```
If you see `Command 'ansible' not found`, add pipx's binary directory to your PATH:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```
To make this change permanent, add it to your shell config:
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 5. Uninstall or Upgrade Ansible
To upgrade Ansible:
```bash
pipx upgrade ansible-core
```
To uninstall Ansible:
```bash
pipx uninstall ansible-core
```

### 6. Verify Installation
To confirm that Ansible is installed, run:
```bash
ansible --version
```
